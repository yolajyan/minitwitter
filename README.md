# minitwitter
spark application - Backend

I created two versions of the mini twitter projects: 
1. twitterbot is the one where user need to manually register their username and password into a hasmap before logging into the page.
2. twitterSQL is the one where it is connected to mySQL workforce and it stores all the information in a table and allows user to also change their passwords.
*since it is connected to the SQL of my own desktop, you might need to create a new database in SQL first before running the program.

Both versions have:
- user registration
- user login
- user logout
- change username (only in twitterSQL)

default username: user
password: 123
(you will need to uncomment the scanner part for userinput in twitterbot if you want to write your own username)

time spent: 4h
